                    <p>
                    At Raytheon, I’ve developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity, focusing on
                    penetration testing, firewall configuration, and IDS setup.
                    I was responsible for implementing security policies and responding swiftly to data security crises,
                    ensuring the protection of corporate infrastructure.

                    In addition to cybersecurity, I managed virtual machines, user accounts, and network equipment,
                    while configuring server hardware and maintaining VMWare infrastructure.
                    My work involved optimizing system performance and ensuring high availability across IT systems.

                    I am proficient in Java, Python, and C++, with experience in scripting. During my internship at Harvard,
                    I applied these programming skills to Quantum Computing projects, solving algorithms and research problems.
                    Through my master’s coursework, I’ve also led large-scale IT projects,
                    including application deployment and building cybersecurity programs,
                    with a focus on cloud computing and project planning.
